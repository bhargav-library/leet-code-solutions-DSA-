/*Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Examples:
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1]

Output: 2*/
